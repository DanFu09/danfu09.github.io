Dan Fu is an incoming assistant professor of computer science and engineering at UCSD, and he is currently a distinguished research scientist at Together AI leading custom model inference. His research develops efficient algorithms for machine learning, with a focus on developing solutions that are both theoretically efficient and practically fast on modern hardware. His research has been recognized with multiple awards at major machine learning conferences, including best student paper runner up (UAI) and multiple oral and spotlight presentations (NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR), and multiple graduate fellowships (Department of Defense NDSEG, Brown Institute), and it has been deployed in production at major technology companies (FlashAttention). Dan conducted his PhD training at Stanford and his undergraduate and masters at Harvard, all in computer science.
